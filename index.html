         <p>Making paella has been a family tradition for a long time. My grandfather was Colombian, and so we keep up
            his tradition of making paella. Within my family, we enjoy adding chorizo, oysters, chicken, and artichokes.
            I have adapted this dish with just vegetables using green beans, chickpeas, and peppers.</p>

         <p>Homemade pizza is tricky to make. Most home ovens do not get hotter than 500&nbsp;&deg;F so some toppings
            are best
            if they are cooked beforehand.</p>
